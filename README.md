# Float 2 string

It was surprising that this feature was not standard. 
And in general, I havenâ€™t found anything similar on the Internet, although everything seems simple.

The main problem solved by the function is the rejection of short recording,
such as `1.234E-10`, without conversion.

So, use it without restrictions.
